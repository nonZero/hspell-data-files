This is a forked version of https://github.com/synhershko/HebMorph for use for quick deployment of https://github.com/synhershko/elasticsearch-analysis-hebrew .

The files in this folder were compiled using version 1.2 of Hspell, the free Hebrew spellchecker and morphology 
engine. 

You can get Hspell from:

Hspell was written by Nadav Har'El and Dan Kenigsberg, and is released under AGPL 3.
